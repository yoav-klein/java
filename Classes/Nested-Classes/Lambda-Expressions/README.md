---

In this directory, we'll follow the scenario described in the Oracle tutorial
about Lambda expressions:

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html

It describes several approaches for addressing the use case. Starting from the most naive
way, and advancing until using Lambda expressions.

1. First - Create methods that search for members that match one criteria
2. Second - Create a more generalized search methods
3. Third - Specify search criteria code in a local class
4. Fourth - Specify search criteria code in an anonymous class
5. Fifth - Specify search criteria code in a Lambda expression
