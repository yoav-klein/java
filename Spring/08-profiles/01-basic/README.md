# Profiles - Basic Example
---

In this project we demonstrate the basic usage of Profiles feature in Spring.

We demonstrate 2 ways of using it: One with a single configuration class, in which we have 2 bean definitions, one for dev and one for prod.
Another way is to use 2 configuration classes, and load both of them.
