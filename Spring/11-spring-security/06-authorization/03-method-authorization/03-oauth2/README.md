# Programmatic Authorization - OAuth2
---

In this project, we demonstrate the usage of method authorization in conjunction with OAuth2. We'll use Google authentication for this obviously.

In this small application, each user has a account (like a bank account). 
Obviously, only the account owner has authorization to access to his account. So, access to an account by an unauthorized user
must result in a 403 response, and prison :).
